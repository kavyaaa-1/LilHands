Most herbal preparations and supplements have not been proven to be safe during pregnancy. Generally, you should not take any over-the-counter medication unless it is necessary.</h5>

Make sure you're wearing protective clothing like a hat, sunglasses etc., for higher protection against the sun. You should use about half a teaspoon of sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or above and touch it up every 2-3 hours for it to work and save your skin against the sun.”</h5>
