                    <h5>Becoming a mother, especially a first-time mom, is a milestone moment in any woman's life, but it comes with its own share of challenges. From morning sickness to dietary changes and skincare woes, your everyday life starts to follow a whole new routine to look after you and your growing baby. We spoke to celebrity dermatologists Dr Jamuna Pai and Dr Harshna Bijlani to tackle all the skin concerns that sprout up when you're pregnant, and devise the best kind of skincare routine that's both safe and simple.</h5>

Make sure you're wearing protective clothing like a hat, sunglasses etc., for higher protection against the sun. You should use about half a teaspoon of sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or above and touch it up every 2-3 hours for it to work and save your skin against the sun.”</h5>

                    <h5>“Though there is no evidence of waxing being unsafe during pregnancy, the increased skin sensitivity, caused due to hormonal changes in the body, can make the procedure more painful,” suggests Dr Pai. While you could still use hair removal creams, the chemicals in them can irritate your skin even further. Make sure you speak to your dermatologist about your best options before using anything new on your skin.</h5>

You still need to use a cleanser, sunscreen, moisturiser etc, to maintain your skin's health. Try using more natural and organic products, if you feel more comfortable,” says Dr Bijlani.</h5>
